5.9 No Fees shall be due to the Affiliate in respect of Events involving users with IP addresses located in countries other than those specified on the Advertiser Offer Page as recorded by the Company.
5.10 The Affiliate acknowledges that the Company’s records and statistics shall be conclusive as to any payment issue relating to this agreement.

6. Support
6.1 The Company has no responsibility to provide any form of support. The Company may in its discretion decide to provide support and, if so, it is entitled to make such support conditional upon payment of its standard fees for such services.
7. Affiliate’s Account
7.1 The Affiliate’s online account for use of the Service is for the Affiliate’s personal use only and is non-transferable. The Affiliate must not authorise or permit any other person to use its account. The Affiliate must take reasonable care to protect and keep confidential its password and other account or identity information. The Affiliate must notify the Company immediately of any apparent breach of security such as loss, theft, misuse or unauthorised disclosure or use of a password. The Affiliate is responsible for third parties who use its account or identity (unless and to the extent that the Company is at fault). 
7.2 The Company reserves the right in its discretion, including if the Affiliate opts for Paypal as a payment method or if the Company suspects that there may have been illicit activity relating to the account, to request by letter, email or otherwise that the Affiliate verify its postal or other contact details and/or its identity and/or to provide information about its methods of generating traffic and/or to provide other information. If the Affiliate fails within the time specified to respond appropriately or at all to any such request, the Company reserves the right to close the Affiliate’s account, in which case any earnings of the Affiliate held in the Affiliate’s account are forfeited to the Company. If the Affiliate asks the Company to reissue any verification request and the Company decides in its discretion to do so, the Company is entitled to require payment of a £10 administration fee.
